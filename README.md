# printing-kiosk
This is a report for the project 'Automated Public Printing Kiosk Design' which was made for the 2 days hackathon named Hackfest25' of IIT(ISM) Dhanbad. I personally worked on the electrical and electronics part of the project and I have uploaded the other files which include the drive circuits, PCB for the drive circuits, control scheme in simulink and stateflow of the whole system. A PPT which was submitted at last in the competetion is also included in this repository, showing the final result. Screenshot of all the ciruits, stateflow etc is present in the file, Printing_Kiosk.pdf, please check the same for a quick reference.
